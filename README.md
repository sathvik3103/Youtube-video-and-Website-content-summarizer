# Youtube-video-and-Website-content-summarizer
This project is a Streamlit application that generates concise summaries of content from YouTube videos and web pages. Built with LangChain and Groq's language model, it uses YoutubeLoader and UnstructuredURLLoader to extract content, then processes it through a summarization chain to produce summaries under 500 words.
